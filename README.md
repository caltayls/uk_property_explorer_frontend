# Property Explorer
An insight into housing costs across England

## Project Overview

This project aims to highlight the variation in house prices across England, within a region, or within London.

Users are able to search by price to get an idea of what type of property can be purchased across an area.

Users can also search by property specifications and observe the variation in price across an area. For example, a user could search for a three bed semi-detached house in the South East of England

## Features

- A table displaying most common attributes of an area's subdivisions
- An interactive map displaying a selection of properties
    - Each property has a popup window containing a summary and an image carousel
